  <h1>Patricia Allen Final Part 2</h1>
  
<h3>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h3>
   
  <p>One time, while I was trying to hack my survival world on Minecraft, I looked up how to open the code file for the game. I turned the 
  brightness up to 100, and then had a great time in the caves. Besides that, I had no previous knowledge of any sort of coding language. </p>

<h3>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</h3>
  
  <p>I built my portfolio from scratch, using simple commands like align, padding, border, etc. I used an external CSS file for all of the styling, and an
  html file for all the content.</p>
  
<h3>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?</h3>
  
  <p>The hardest part of making my portfolio was the CSS. It took a lot of trial and error to get things to look right. 
  A lot of the commands would mess each other up, and I had trouble with spacing all the elements right. I tried
  to keep it basic so I could at least have a readable webpage.</p>
  
<h3>How has taking this class changed your view on Web Development?</h3> 
  
  <p>Since I had never even seen code before, I don't think I had much of an opinion on web development previous to taking the class.
    After taking the class, I think that anyone can learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
  It really is like learning a new language, so it can get difficult the further you go. I would love to continue making simple
  pages and creating programs for fun. </p>
  
<h3>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h3>
  
  <p>For future students, I would reccomend starting assignments as early as you can. That way you can reach out early for help, 
  and also give yourself enough time to figure it out on your own. Reading the textbook and using websites like w3schools is like
    having a cheatsheet when you're writing your code, so students should utilize them. </p>
